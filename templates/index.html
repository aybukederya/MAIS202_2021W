<p style="font-family:monospace; font-size:15px; line-height:1.5"> Hi! Are you confident in your musical knowledge? Can you identify pieces with their composers easily? Do you know all the piano pieces of Chopin? Are you a Bach fan? Well, the computer is challenging you for a competition! <br> <br>
In this competition, you will listen to five pieces and your aim is to select their correct composers. The computer will do the same. I guarentee you that the computer has never heard any of these pieces. 
<br> <br> Yet, <mark>it was trained on hundreds of pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt and Schubert</mark>. It uses a <mark>random forest machine learning model to predict the composer</mark> of the newly heard song, based on its numerous musical attributes and how they relate to the pieces of the same composers the computer was trained on. 
<br><br> I warn you: the model has an <mark>accuracy score of 77% on the validation set</mark>, which is three times the random guess accuracy! Are you up for the challenge? </p>
